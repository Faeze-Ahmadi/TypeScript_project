## js-12

## This is a repository for JavaScript project 12, designed using vite bundler

In fact, this project is the same codes of project 10 and 11, this time I implemented the html code with typescript
Of course, I am still not that skilled in this field and I wrote the drawer code with flowbite and I also feel that this project has errors that I will fix in the future with more information that I get.
